When one host wants to transmit a frame, it listens on the medium to check if the medium is busy. After it senses that no one else is transmitting, the host starts transmitting the frame, it also monitors the current level to detect a collision. If it detects a collision, it transmits a special jam signal so that all other hosts can know there was a collision. The other host will receive this jam signal and stop transmitting.

However, when a host needs to send a message to a remote network, it must use the router, also known as the default gateway. This is because the data link frame address of the remote destination host cannot be used directly. Instead, the IP packet has to be sent to the router (default gateway) and the router will forward the packet toward its destination. Therefore, if the default gateway is incorrectly configured, the host can communicate with other hosts on the same network, but not with hosts on remote networks.",

Network attackers could manipulate MAC address and IP address mappings in ARP messages with the intent to intercept network traffic. ARP requests and replies cause entries to be made into the ARP table, not the MAC address table. ARP table overflows are very unlikely. Manually configuring static ARP associations is a way to prevent, not facilitate, ARP poisoning and MAC address spoofing. Multiple ARP replies resulting in the switch MAC address table containing entries that match the MAC addresses of connected nodes and are associated with the relevant switch port are required for normal switch frame forwarding operations. It is not an ARP caused network problem.",

This information could simply be collected or modified for a specific purpose and delivered to its original destination.Eavesdropping attack– When devices are being installed, the threat actor can intercept data such as security keys that are used by constrained devices to establish communications once they are up and running.SQL injection (SQLi)– Threat actors uses a flaw in the Structured Query Language (SQL) application that allows them to have access to modify the data or gain administrative privileges.Routing attack– A threat actor could either place a rogue routing device on the network or modify routing packets to manipulate routers to send all packets to the chosen destination of the threat actor. The threat actor could then drop specific packets, known as selective forwarding, or drop all packets, known as a sinkhole attack.",

However, since NAT hides the actual IP addresses that are used by end devices, it may cause problems for some applications that require end-to-end connectivity.",

Both versions have a Source (IP) Address field. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits; IPv6 addresses are 128 bits. The Time-to-Live or TTL field in IPv4 is now called Hop Limit in IPv6, but this field serves the same purpose in both versions. The value in this 8-bit field decrements each time a packet passes through any router. When this value is 0, the packet is discarded and is not forwarded to any other router.",

            "explanation": "Explanation:The Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) process is a contention-based media access control mechanism used on shared media access networks, such as Ethernet. When a device needs to transmit data, it listens and waits until the media is available (quiet), then it will send data. If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision will occur. Both devices will detect the collision on the network. When a device detects a collision, it will stop the data transmission process, wait for a random amount of time, then try again.",

At the other end of the link, the receiving device that sees no tag knows the specific VLAN number because the receiving device must have the exact native VLAN number. The native VLAN should be an unused VLAN that is distinct from VLAN1, the default VLAN, as well as other VLANs. Data VLANs, also known as user VLANs, are configured to carry user-generated traffic, with the exception of high priority traffic, such as VoIP. Voice VLANs are configured for VoIP traffic.

LACP can be used for the same purpose between Cisco and non-Cisco devices. PAgP must have the same duplex mode at both ends and can use two ports or more. The number of ports depends on the switch platform or module. An EtherChannel aggregated link is seen as one port by the spanning-tree algorithm.",

Most switches perform only one level of 802.1Q de-encapsulation, which allows an attacker to embed a hidden 802.1Q tag inside the frame. This tag allows the frame to be forwarded to a VLAN that the original 802.1Q tag did not specify. An important characteristic of the double-encapsulated VLAN hopping attack is that it works even if trunk ports are disabled, because a host typically sends a frame on a segment that is not a trunk link. This type of attack is unidirectional and works only when the attacker is connected to a port residing in the same VLAN as the native VLAN of the trunk port.",

The lower an administrative distance, the more trustworthy the learned route is. When a router learns multiple routes toward the same destination, the router uses the administrative distance value to determine which route to place into the routing table. A metric is used by a routing protocol to compare routes received from the routing protocol. An exit interface is the interface used to send a packet in the direction of the destination network. A routing protocol is used to exchange routing updates between two or more adjacent routers.",

If the route in the table disappears, the floating static route will be put into the routing table in its place. Internal EIGRP has an AD of 90, so a floating static route in this scenario would need to have an AD higher than 90. Also, when creating a static route to a multiaccess interface like a FastEthernet segment a fully specified route should be used, with both a next-hop IP address and an exit interface. This prevents the router from doing a recursive lookup, but still ensures the correct next-hop device on the multiaccess segment forwards the packet.",
